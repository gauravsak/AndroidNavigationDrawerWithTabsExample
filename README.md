# AndroidNavigationDrawerWithTabsExample
Basic example of a native Android app with navigation drawer and tabs on home screen along with example unit tests in Robolectric and UI tests in expresso and Robotium

## Softwares and Libraries
1. Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
2. Android SDK 5.0 Lollipop Level 22
3. Android Studio 1.1.0
4. Other dependencies mentioned in project build.gradle

## What the example offers
1. Integration of different libraries to create a templated app structure which is common to most of the native android apps.
2. Example unit tests with Robolectric. **NOTE:** These tests only run via gradle. Android Studio support for Unit testing is still experimental.
3. Example UI automation tests with Expresso and Robotium. (I find Robotium rich and easy compared to Expresso)
4. Integration of two existing famous Android examples [PageSlidingTabStrip](https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip) and [Official Android Navigation Drawer Example](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html).
5. Thanks to [this](https://github.com/Balaji-K13/Navigation-drawer-page-sliding-tab-strip) existing example of the integration of these to libraries.
